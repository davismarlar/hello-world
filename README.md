==================

hello,
my name is davis marlar and i am a cow here at the academy. I am from carrollton Ga and i came here as a recruited baseball player. I played baseball for two years here before retiring and becoming a snowboard instructor. In my free time i enjoy hunting, fishing, football, and doing every other outdoors thing you can think of, except long walks on the beach. my favorite teams are the atlanta falcons, clemson tigers, and of course the army black knights.

yeeet,
davis marlar
